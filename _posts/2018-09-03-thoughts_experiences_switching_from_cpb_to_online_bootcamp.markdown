Feeling like I’ve been with Flatiron School for years… literally… 

I first came across Flatiron School the summer of 2016. The long summer holiday is an ideal time for exploring and contemplating a career change for a Montessori preschool teacher. After trying out some free courses on various coding plate-forms, which included Flatiron School’s Learn, Codecademy and Udacity, I decided to enroll with the Community-powered Bootcamp (Full Stack Web Development curriculum). 

It made perfect sense for me to join this program March of 2017. It was a time of change, a transition period of getting ready to relocate from the history rich city of Philadelphia to Tampa Florida, the city of sunshine. It was a busy time of settling and re-establishing new routines, so I knew there would be many interludes, of which I will not be studying. The flexibility to study at my own pace and only forking out $149 each month instead of the $1,500 per month for the Online bootcamp was ideal for me.

Nearly a year and a half later, routines set & established and having stopped teaching, it made perfect sense to switch from Community-powered Bootcamp to the Online Bootcamp early August, this year. As the CPB curriculum covered is the same as the Online program, my completed labs carried over seamlessly. 

Thoughts, experiences… working on the labs without access to technical coach support and Learn instructor lead study group is not an easy task, especially when there’s a problem in finishing up a lab. Ask a Question on the CPB and the community-bootcamp Slack group is not that active. However, the open Slack groups is an excellent venue for getting help, especially when one is exasperated with not being able to setup ```rake console```, which was coded exactly as how it’s effortlessly shown by Avi Flombaum on the Study Videos!

Major difference between the Ask a Question on CPB and Online is that the Online version is readily supported by technical coaches, including support via screen share if an issue is more complicated. Whilst on the CPB version, you only get as good a help as your next fellow students can give. Many of whom, including myself, are on the program sporadically.

On joining the Online program, it’s like a breath of fresh air to discover the Learn instructor lead study groups! I’ve lost count on the exact number that I attended… probably around 20 sessions in the 3 weeks since switching over. These study group sessions help in solidifying my understanding of concepts learned while on the CPB track. In particular, the Sunday code challenge study group is totally engaging, being giving a problem to solve in a group with your peers, is challenging in a positive way.   

Did you know that Portfolio projects submitted under the CPB track are not assessed by Learn instructors? That’s another plus about the Online program. Your portfolio projects are assessed. The experience gained from the assessment interview will be great practice for when I’m job searching. It prepares you for the one-on-one interview process of explaining your code and sharing your technical knowledge. I’m excited to re-submit my first Portfolio project soon.

I look forward to revising over the labs I’ve completed and working on the new labs with the support of Learn coaches and instructors. In particular, I look forward to the career service portion of the Online program. The motivation is strong to reach the career coaching stage and find a job as a junior developer!
