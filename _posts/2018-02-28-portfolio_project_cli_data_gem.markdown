Book-Releases is my first portfolio project for the Full Stack Web Development program.  

Book-Releases is a CLI Ruby Gem that lists upcoming book releases by "Barnes and Noble" and "Books a Million". This gem provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) for user to choose their preferred store to get a list of the upcoming book releases as well as a detailed information of the book.

The project seems overwhelming at firstâ€¦ where do I start? Only known fact at the start of this project was that it'll be closely related to books as I enjoyed reading. 

Not sure how to start, I watched all of Avi's video related to this project. As Avis suggested, I outlined the interface and noted down what I wanted of the application first. To create the ruby gem, I used bundler, which sets up the architecture of the application, ensuring that the files and directories layout are appropriate for ruby gems.

The application uses Open-uri and Nokogiri (both are ruby gems) to access and scrape the Barnes & Noble and Books a Million websites for upcoming book releases information. The use of Pry to debug in real time was instrumental for me in extracting the required HTML and CSS information from the webpages.

During the project, there was many days lost when I cannot fix a program bug. But, whether because I restart my computer or through the use of the Pry debugger, things do eventually move forward. Never lose hope!

This CLI gem is on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/book-releases)
- To install the gem, type 'gem install book-releases' on the command prompt
- To run the application, type 'book-releases'

Book-Releases code is on [github](https://github.com/nichia/book_releases_cli_app).
